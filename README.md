# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project uses a big dataset to do data cleaning and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) entirely with Python.

## Disclaimer
This project was inspired by a Youtube video made by Ryan & Matt Data Science which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZFkPw87ng&t=2781s).<br/>
However, please bear in mind that all the codes in the Jupyter Notebook uploaded above and the summary of findings in this README file were written by me!

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains more than **7M race records** registered between 1798 and 2022. More specifically, it contains **7,461,226 ultra-marathon race records from 1,641,168 unique athletes** in CSV format. The dataset can be downloaded on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/data).

### Data Structure & Types
Using a simple line of code on Python, we can take a peek at the structure of dataset: 7,461,195 rows and 13 columns!
