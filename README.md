# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project uses a big dataset to do data cleaning and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) entirely with Python.

## Disclaimer
This project was inspired by a Youtube video made by Ryan & Matt Data Science which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZFkPw87ng&t=2781s).<br/>
However, please bear in mind that all the codes in the Jupyter Notebook uploaded above and the summary of findings in this README file were written by me!
